                <p className="heading-desc">There isn’t a winning template to create a great 
                About Us page. However, there are key components to make a convincing pitch with your 
                brand story.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p className = "heading-level2">Your Mission</p>
                <p className="heading-desc">You don’t need to outright say,
                <span>“our mission is ____,”</span>
                but you should convey the mission of your business in your About Us copy. This is key for 
                attracting talent, as well as leads that have Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals.</p>
                <p className="heading-desc">Some centennial enterprises have pages of content that can 
                fit in this section, while startups can tell the story of how the company was born, 
                its challenges, and its vision for the future.</p>

                <p className = "heading-level2">Your Services (And Benefits)</p>
                <p className="heading-desc">Of course, you have a homepage and dedicated pages for your 
                products, but summarizing your offerings on the About Us page is crucial to tie them in 
                with <span>brand values in your messaging.</span></p>

            <div>
                <p className = "heading-level2">Your Social Proof</p>
                <p className="heading-desc">Reviews, client logos, case studies, and results bring 
                consistency to your About Us page. It’s what really proves what you are saying is real 
                and the impact you can bring to future clients.</p>
                <p className="heading-desc">With these components in mind, you will have a <span>framework 
                from which to build an engaging and unique About Us page.</span></p>
