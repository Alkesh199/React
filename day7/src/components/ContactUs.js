            <p className="heading-desc">The essential elements of an excellent Contact Us page include a 
            clear call to action, easy navigation, and a message that resonates with visitors.</p>
            <p className="heading-desc">Keep these things in mind when designing a Contact Us page: Don’t 
            overload visitors with too much information, use readable text, and create a landing page that 
            converts.</p>
            <p className="heading-desc">A well-designed contact page should include several elements, 
            such as a phone number, email address, and social media links.</p>
            <p className="heading-desc">In addition, a Contact Us page must be easily visible on your 
            navigation bar. It can be frustrating for a consumer to hunt through a website to find out 
            how to contact a company.</p>

            As we’ll note in other Contact Us pages, we begin with an engaging heading, “Have questions? 
            Shoot us an Email.”<br/>And then simplify the page with easy buttons that adjust the topic 
            for the contact form on the page.</p>
