● - What is `NPM`?
A react app is powered by lots of many things, it's not only linited to React.
so to manages our all the package we need a package manager. that's why we use npm. 
in npm official website there is nothing mention like node package manager.

npm is a package manager.


● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
parcel/Webpack are the open source bundlers. supported by popular languages like typescript , sass etc.
before pushing our code to dev environment we need some optimization to make our app performant. 
there are some task which are performed by the parcel:
1. HMR (hot module reloading)
2. File Watcher Algorithms written in c++
3. Bundling
4. MINIFY
5. cleaning our code (Removing console)
7. super fast build algorithms
8. image optimization
9. Caching While Development
10. Compression
11. Compaitable with older versions of browsers.
12. HTTPS on dev (npx parcel index.html --https)
13. Managing Port numbers
14. Consistant hashing algo. (to maintain intergity)
15. zero configuration bundler 
16. creats server for use

so we can say parcel is a "BEAST"



● - What is `.parcel-cache`
parcel-cache  stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds,
 it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel 
 can be so fast in development mode. 


● - What is `npx` ?
The command npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager, and npx is used to 
execute JavaScript  packages downloaded this way.npx helps us avoid versioning, dependency issues and 
installing unnecessary packages that we just want to try out.
