Q3 What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content 
close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored 
on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed. By caching content physically close to where a 
user is and reducing the distance it has to travel, latency is reduced. This process also decreases stress on origin servers
 by distributing the load geographically across multiple servers.
