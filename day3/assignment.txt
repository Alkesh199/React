1. What is JSX?
Ans . JSX is Html like syntex. just like 
const heading = <h1>this is Heading</h1>
it's produce React Element. we can say above example is example of react Element. it place elements 
inside Dom without React.createElement.
purpose to make it Easier to Create React Component.


2. Superpowers of React?
 1. can Embade Expression in JSX.
 Ex . 
     let marks = 64;
     let std = 10;
     const a = <h1>i have {marks} % marks in {std}th class</h1>
    we can write any valid js inside curley brackets.

 2. we can use quotes or curley bracket to specify attributes
 ex .
    const lk = <a href="https://xyz/pqr.com">click here</a>

    let url = "https://www.google.com";

    const im = <img src = {url} />

3. It can contain children , for that we have to use it inside ()
   const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);

4. It prevent injection attack.
ex if we are calling any api in our code , may be hacker modify our data , they may injected 
something, so jsx always gives us gurantee that can not render in dom which we didn't code explictly.
it first convert it to string , this helps us to prevent XXl (cross site scripting-attack)

5. EOD JSx Represent Objetct 
Ex : <h1 className = "title" id="first">this is title</h1>

This is same as 
React.createElement("h1",{
   className:"title",
   id:"first"
},"this is title)

it's done by the Babel

Q3. use of type in script ?
The type attribute specifies the Internet media type (formerly known as MIME type) 
of the linked document.

Q.4 {TitleComponet} vs {<TitleComponet/>} vs {<TitleComponet><TitleComponet/>}


first one is simple any js expression . 
2 and 3rd are the way of calling components
